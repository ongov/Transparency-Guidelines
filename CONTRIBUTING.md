# Contribution guidelines

## Welcome!
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an Ontario Digital Service (ODS) project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [ODS Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heWtqC8AnAF4-5FNEdX311o5E4FPNnfboOxbsTpYmco) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's contributing policy (you are here), its [license](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

You can share your thoughts and ideas by:

* emailing amy.bihari@ontario.ca
* forking our GitHub repository

### By email

* Send us plain text formats like text files, Word documents and Google docs by email
* Do not send HTML, PDF, printed paper or handwritten notes
* Tell us what section your suggestions apply to
* If you’re sending email or plain text: include the original text for reference and your proposed changes
* If you’re sending a Word or Google document: use track changes or suggest mode
* Tell us the reason for your suggestion and the benefit it will have

### On GitHub

NOTE: The `develop` branch is a working draft. The official version is in the master branch.

* Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) to format your changes
* Don't use HTML unless the changes you want to make are not supported in markdown (for example, headings inside a table)
* Fork off of our `develop` branch, and make a pull request back to develop when you’re ready to merge.
* Name your branch with your first name or user name, the type of change (“fix” for small cosmetic edits,  “feature” for any additions or deletions), followed by a description of your changes. For example: `name/fix/correcting-typos` OR `name/feature/updates-to-standard`
* Make one commit per change and explain the reasoning for your change in your commit message (not what you changed, but why)
